Final Project "Treasure Hunt

# Situation
Every summer holiday, the BZ Berner Zeitung does a treasure hunt f√ºr the readers and such who should become readers. It is called "BZ Schatzsuche".
It is about 5 or 6 weeks and we have about 25000 people who are treasure hunting. At the moment you can only participate with a printed map. 

# How does it work
You have 5 routes. Each with about 15-18 Points where you have to count something. 
After 3 or 4 point you have to calculate a number which is one of the 3 needed keys for opening the treasure box at the end.

# Project
My projet treasure hunt is a app where you can participate at the treasure hunt with your mobile device.

# Advantage app over map (USP)
With the app you have a control if your keys for the treasure box are right. 
But only the key will be checked not the corect answer of the separate points. 
So if one key is wrong you have the chance to go back and find the right number for the key. 

# Needs
I will need backend and frontend.
Backend where the user can login/signup and a DB for storing the answers.
Frontend where you can choice the route, input the answers and showing what to do.

# Goal
Build the hole app, who works for all 5 routes (my wish, maybe it will be just one route ;-))
